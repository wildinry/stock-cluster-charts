Different stock Clustering charts

Kmeanmain.py is a file that is meant to download the SP100 stock tickers to then group them based off the hurtz exponent (likely to revert back to the mean) 

main.py is similar but uses OPTICS over Kmean to chart the output of the SP100 stocks. 

Ideally this is meant to find stocks that are crossing there mean to watch for when they hit there "low" on the z score chart.
